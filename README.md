 Automation guide 
Needed Libraries:
1.	Selenium
2.	TestNG
3.	Apache apoi 
Steps:
1.	Open project in eclipse 
2.	Load the libraries 
3.	Open testng .xml and run the project while standing on this page so it would run on parallel pages. 
Notes: 
1.	I loaded test data from excel files so it loads extra nulls in the end that I couldn’t get rid of so the last test cases with nulls would fail 
2.	The excel sheet has a column in the end with the expected result which I assert to make sure it’s met. 
3.	In facebook there’s a field that appears once you enter your email in correct format to re-enter the email, I considered doing test cases for it however all the negative test cases for the main field couldn’t be done because the second field doesn’t appear unless the first field appears.
